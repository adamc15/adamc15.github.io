## What Are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?

NFTs are revolutionizing the digital art and collectibles industry, transforming the lives of digital artists and creating new opportunities for celebrities to connect with their fans. But NFTs are not limited to art; they can represent ownership of unique assets in both the digital and physical realms.

Imagine if Andy Warhol were born in the late '90s; he might have minted his iconic works as NFTs. It's only a matter of time before we see Kanye West tokenizing his Yeezys on Ethereum. NFTs could even prove ownership of your car one day.

## How Do NFTs Work?

NFTs are unique units of data stored on a blockchain, enabling them to be bought and traded. Each NFT can represent a specific digital or physical asset along with a license for its use. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are not interchangeable, as each may represent a different asset with its own value.

NFTs are created through cryptographic transactions on blockchains, providing a secure and trackable ownership system. However, it's crucial to maintain data links to preserve access to the associated assets.

## What are Non-Fungible Tokens? (NFTs)
NFTs are currently taking the digital art and collectibles world by storm. Digital artists are seeing their lives change thanks to huge sales to a new crypto-audience. And celebrities are joining in as they spot a new opportunity to connect with fans. But digital art is only one way to use NFTs. Really they can be used to represent ownership of any unique asset, like a deed for an item in the digital or physical realm.

If Andy Warhol had been born in the late 90s, he probably would have minted Campbell's Soup as an NFT. It's only a matter of time before Kanye puts a run of Yeezys on Ethereum. And one day owning your car might be proved with an NFT.

## How do NFTs Work?
An NFT is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, which can be sold and traded. The NFT can be associated with a particular digital or physical asset (such as a file or a physical object) and a license to use the asset for a specified purpose. NFTs (and the associated license to use, copy or display the underlying asset) can be traded and sold on digital markets.

NFTs function like cryptographic tokens, but, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, hence not fungible. While all bitcoins are equal, each NFT may represent a different underlying asset and thus have a different value. NFTs are created when blockchains string records of cryptographic hash, a set of characters identifying a set of data, onto previous records therefore creating a chain of identifiable data blocks. This cryptographic transaction process ensures the authentication of each digital file by providing a digital signature that is used to track NFT ownership. However, data links that point to details like where the art is stored can die.
