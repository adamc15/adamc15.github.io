## Welcome to OBADA

OBADA is an industry coalition made up of stakeholders in the IT asset disposition (ITAD) industry.  We have gotten together to create a public utility that will allow any enterprise or supply chain systems to digitally represent their physical assets as NFTs (pNFTs), in effect creating a decentralized "Carfaxâ„¢" for physical assets. This allows for permanent, interoperable recordkeeping of any asset, from manufacturer the recycler. And it gives the world a standard interface for ordering and tracking end-of-life services such as data destruction and recycling.

<!-- "OBADA" consist of two organizations; the nonprofit OBADA Foundation and the OBADA DAO.  The foundation is working with the International Standards Organization (ISO) to develop a standard for creating and storing digital representions of physical assets in a blockchain.   The OBADA DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization developing decentralized registry based on the standard to store the Carfax-like digital representations (i.e. the pNFTs). -->

## The OBADA DAO

The OBADA DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a coalition of stakeholders from the IT asset disposition (ITAD) industry. There are currently 25 DAO Members and we are processing a waitlist of 59 more.   The DAO is capped at 101 members.   Please see this links below.

## The OBADA Foundation
[The OBADA Foundation](https://www.obadafoundation.org/about), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is developing an [an open standard](https://www.obada.io/standard/) called "Representing Physical Assets using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)" in conjunction with the International Standards Organization [ISO TC/307 AHG3](https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html).  This open blockchain protocol will allow any organization or ecosystem to establish their own NFT implementation for their own category of physical assets which will be interoperable across all categories. --> 

## The ITAD Blockchain
The OBADA DAO is creating a decentralized registry to store pNFTs, with methods for connecting to the backend systems of the actors and software used by the asset disposition sector to write, read and transfer data. The registry acts as a "bridge" between the real-world asset and it's digital representation. (pNFT) This will allow enterprise and supply chain systems to track the service history of any asset, from manufacturer the recycler. and creates a simple, standard interface for the world to order and track asset disposition services such as data destruction and responsible recycling.

## The <span>OBADA</span> Standard
The OBADA Foundation is steward of the OBADA standard. We have been working with ISO since 2019 to develop it as an international standard.
The standard consists of an open data methods for representing an immutable physical asset identifier as a cryptographic addresses, a data method for creating a cryptographic checksum of all associated asset data, and an open protocol for transferring and resolving the data. [read more](https://www.obada.io/standard/)...


<p><br></p>


## The <span>OBADA</span> Platform
<div class="block">
    <p>The OBADA DAO was formed to create a platform, a Physical NFT Registry, that implements the standard. The platform is based on open W3C DID (decentralized identifier) methods. We previously worked on proof of concepts based on Hyperledger and Ethereum. Current development is based on Cosmos, using the Tendermint consensus algorithm.</p>

## FUTURE:  Platform Economics: Rewards for Recycling

		<p>IN the current implementation, "gas" for basic transactions is paid with a native utility token.  Collected gas fees are distributed back to the nodeholders to compensate them for their compute power.  There is no middleman.</p>
	</div>
    <div class="block">
        <img src="/assets/svg/reward.svg" class="block__image" alt="" width="80" height="80">
		<p>In the future, the same utility token is used to "order traceability". The mechanism is by "staking" the NFT. The stake, plus a reward, is returned upon proof of recycling.</p>
		<p>There is expected to be a high loss rate of staked tokens, due to the nature of recycling, as the real-world assets are lost from the chain. These tokens will be replaced by the newly issued tokens that are created with proof of recycling.</p>
		<p>This unique cryptoeconomic mechanism, where the total token supply is not maintained by cryptographic methods, but rather by the real-world actions, creates a world-changing incentive structure for proper recycling.</p>

* There is no offer for investment here. OBADA DAO membership is not an investment.
* A decentralzied ledger keeping track of "system credits" is necessary to coordinate the activity and system functions between nodes operated by the DAO members.  While this ledger could be described in terms of a utility token, at this time there are no plans to offer any native token to the general public nor on any public token exchange.
